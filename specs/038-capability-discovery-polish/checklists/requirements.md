# Specification Quality Checklist: Capability Discovery Polish

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-18
**Feature**: [specs/038-capability-discovery-polish/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) _Note: For refactoring tasks, architectural entities are permitted._
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders _Note: Audience includes SDK consumers/maintainers._
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
      _Refined to focus on outcomes (e.g., single location for logic)._
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification _See note on architectural entities._

## Notes

- Spec ready for planning.
